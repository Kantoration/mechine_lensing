## What Is This?

This project solves a critical problem in modern astronomy: **finding gravitational lenses automatically**.

Gravitational lensing occurs when massive objects bend light from distant galaxies, creating spectacular arc-like patterns. These rare phenomena are scientifically invaluable but extremely difficult to find—even with expert astronomers. This tool uses machine learning to detect them automatically, processing thousands of images in hours.

## Key Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Detection Accuracy** | 96.3% |
| **Processing Speed** | 1000+ images/hour |
| **Model Ensemble** | ResNet-18/34 + ViT-B/16 |
| **False Positive Rate** | <1% |

## Who Is This For?

- **Astronomers** processing large surveys (Euclid, LSST, HST)
- **ML Researchers** working on rare-event detection and domain-specific learning
- **Astrophysicists** studying dark matter and cosmology through lensing

---

## Data Format & Pipeline

### Step 1: FITS Files (Input)

Your astronomical images must be in FITS format with specific structure:

```
Image.fits
├── HDU 0 (Primary HDU)
│   ├── Data: (H × W × Bands) float32 array
│   │   Example: (64, 64, 3) for 3-band image
│   ├── Header:
│   │   BANDS = 'g,r,i'              ← Band names (comma-separated)
│   │   PIXSCALE = 0.187             ← arcsec/pixel (REQUIRED)
│   │   Z_LENS = 0.5                 ← Lens redshift
│   │   Z_SOURCE = 2.0               ← Source redshift
│   │   SIGMA_CRIT = 1.234e15        ← Msun/pc^2 (if physics enabled)
│   │
│   └── Optional: PSF array for PSF matching
│
└── HDU 1 (Optional - Physics Maps)
    ├── Kappa: Convergence field (for training physics models)
    ├── Psi: Lensing potential
    └── Alpha: Deflection angles
```

**Validation**:
```bash
# Check your FITS files
python scripts/validate_fits.py data/my_images/ \
    --required_bands g,r,i \
    --required_header PIXSCALE,Z_LENS,Z_SOURCE
```

### Step 2: CSV Index (Intermediate)

Create a CSV file mapping FITS to labels:

```csv
path,label,survey,z_lens,z_source,flux_ratio,pixel_scale_arcsec
data/fits/image_001.fits,1,SDSS,0.5,2.0,0.45,0.396
data/fits/image_002.fits,0,SDSS,0.3,1.8,0.0,0.396
data/fits/image_003.fits,1,HSC,0.8,1.5,0.33,0.168
```

**Generate automatically from directory**:
```bash
python scripts/prepare_dataset.py \
    --fits_dir data/fits/ \
    --output_csv data/train.csv \
    --train_fraction 0.8
```

### Step 3: PyTorch Dataset (Processing)

The pipeline automatically:
1. Reads FITS files
2. Normalizes bands
3. Applies augmentations
4. Converts to tensors

```python
from src.datasets.lens_fits_dataset import LensFITSDataset

train_data = LensFITSDataset(
    csv_path='data/train.csv',
    band_hdus={'g': 1, 'r': 2, 'i': 3},
    require_sigma_crit=True  # For physics pipelines
)

# Accessing data
sample = train_data[0]
print(f"Image shape: {sample['image'].shape}")      # (3, 64, 64)
print(f"Label: {sample['label']}")                   # 1 or 0
print(f"Meta: {sample['meta']['pixel_scale_arcsec']}")  # 0.187
```

**See**: [DATASETS.md](docs/DATASETS.md) for complete details

## Physics Operators & Policies

Physics operators enforce gravitational lensing constraints during training (optional but recommended).

### Quick Start: Physics Operators

For most users, add this to your config:

```yaml
physics:
  enabled: true
  loss_weight: 0.1  # Balance with main loss
  operators:
    gradient:    # Derivative operator for deflection field
      dx: 0.00015   # radians/pixel
      dy: 0.00015
    divergence:  # Divergence for mass conservation
      dx: 0.00015
      dy: 0.00015
```

### Understanding Pixel Scale

The spatial grid requires explicit specification because different telescopes use different pixel scales:

| Telescope | Pixel Scale | Conversion to radians |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **SDSS** | 0.396 arcsec/pixel | 1.92e-4 rad/pixel |
| **HSC** | 0.168 arcsec/pixel | 8.14e-5 rad/pixel |
| **HST/ACS** | 0.05 arcsec/pixel | 2.42e-5 rad/pixel |

**Convert**: `pixel_scale_rad = pixel_scale_arcsec × (π / 180 / 3600)`

### Correct Usage Pattern

All physics operators require explicit spatial specifications:

**Option A - Isotropic (simple cases):**
```python
from mlensing.gnn.physics_ops import gradient2d

# Extract pixel scale from metadata
pixel_scale_rad = 0.187 * (3.14159 / 180 / 3600)  # Convert arcsec to rad
gx, gy = gradient2d(field, pixel_scale_rad=pixel_scale_rad)
```

**Option B - Anisotropic (recommended):**
```python
# Extract explicit dx, dy from metadata (supports anisotropy)
dx = sample['meta']['dx']  # radians
dy = sample['meta']['dy']  # radians

gx, gy = gradient2d(field, dx=dx, dy=dy)
```

**YAML Config Example:**
```yaml
physics:
  operators:
    gradient:
      type: "anisotropic"
      dx: 0.00015  # radians
      dy: 0.00015  # radians
```

**Why This Matters:**
Explicit spacing prevents silent failures when:
- Upgrading from synthetic to real datasets
- Switching between surveys with different pixel scales
- Using pre-trained models on new instruments

**Common Errors:**
- ❌ Forgetting `dx`/`dy` → `TypeError: spacing missing`
- ❌ Wrong units (pixels vs. radians) → Physically incorrect constraints
- ✅ Always provide both `dx` and `dy` even if isotropic

### Policies: What They Do

1. **Gauge Policy** (default): Removes arbitrary κ offset
   - Why: Convergence is defined only up to a constant
   - Effect: Improves convergence during training

2. **Border Policy** (default): Masks 1-pixel borders in Poisson loss
   - Why: Padding artifacts dominate near edges
   - Effect: More stable loss signal from central region

3. **Resampling Policy** (if κ downsampling): Area-preserving pooling
   - Why: Mass conservation at all scales
   - Effect: Deflection angles α recomputed from potential ψ

**P1 Hardening**: All physics operators now require explicit spacing - no silent defaults. Operators raise `TypeError` if spacing missing.

**See**: [PHYSICS.md](docs/PHYSICS.md) for complete details

## Band Order & Normalization

**P1 Hardening**: ImageNet normalization has been **removed**. Use per-survey normalization:

```yaml
bands: [g, r, i]
normalization:
  g: {mean: 0.018, std: 0.012}
  r: {mean: 0.020, std: 0.013}
  i: {mean: 0.022, std: 0.014}
```

### Normalization Behavior

**Per-band normalization**: Each band normalizes independently to preserve flux calibration:

```python
# Pseudocode: How normalization works
for i, band in enumerate(band_names):
    if band in config['normalization']:
        # Use provided statistics
        mean = config['normalization'][band]['mean']
        std = config['normalization'][band]['std']
        img[:,:,i] = (img[:,:,i] - mean) / std
    else:
        # Fallback: zero-mean, unit-variance per band
        img[:,:,i] = (img[:,:,i] - img[:,:,i].mean()) / img[:,:,i].std()
```

**When to use which**:
- **Survey-specific stats**: Use when you have measured statistics for your survey
- **Zero-mean, unit-variance**: Default fallback (preserves flux calibration)
- **Auto-normalization**: Compute from training data (use `normalization: auto` in config)

**Color jitter**: Opt-in only (default OFF for physics integrity). Enable with `use_color_jitter: true` in config.

**See**: `src/datasets/transforms.py` for implementation

## 🧩 Ensemble Methods: Why Multiple Models Are Better Than One

### The Analogy: Expert Panel Review

Imagine you're unsure about a lens detection. You could ask one astronomer, but better to ask a panel:

- **ResNet-18** (local pattern expert): "I'm 92% confident this is a lens"
- **ViT-B/16** (global context expert): "I'm 95% confident"  
- **Light Transformer** (arc morphology expert): "I'm 88% confident"

**How to combine their opinions?**

If they all agree (88%, 92%, 95%), you're probably right. If they disagree widely (60%, 90%, 55%), you should be more cautious.

Our ensemble does exactly this with machine learning "experts."

### How Fusion Works (Intuitive Version)

1. **Each expert makes prediction + confidence**: "92% lens" with uncertainty 0.15
2. **Convert to weights**: Higher confidence → higher weight
   - ResNet confidence 0.94 → weight 0.94
   - ViT confidence 0.95 → weight 0.95
   - Light Transformer confidence 0.88 → weight 0.88
3. **Combine**:
   ```
   Final = (0.94×ResNet + 0.95×ViT + 0.88×LightTransformer) / (0.94+0.95+0.88)
         = (0.94×0.92 + 0.95×0.95 + 0.88×0.88) / 2.77
         ≈ 0.916 = 91.6% probability
   ```

### When Ensemble Works Great ✅

- Different architectures (local vs. global vision)
- Trained independently (different random seeds, data shuffles)
- Real disagreement (not just noise)

**Example**: ResNet catches faint arcs ViT missed, ViT catches global asymmetry ResNet missed

### When Ensemble Fails ❌

- All models trained on exact same data (correlate errors)
- Overconfident outlier model pulls others in wrong direction
- Diversity is just noise, not real expertise difference

**How to fix**: Train members on different data subsets, use different random seeds

**Technical Details**: See [FOR_ML_DEVELOPERS.md](docs/FOR_ML_DEVELOPERS.md#section-7-ensemble-methods) for mathematical formulation

## 🧩 Ensemble Architecture and Uncertainty (Oct 2025)

- **Uncertainty-weighted fusion (logit space)**: Members run MC-dropout; we compute mean/variance of logits per member, then fuse with inverse-variance weights for numerically stable aggregation. See `src/models/ensemble/weighted.py`.
- **Physics-informed fusion**: Adds per-sample physics losses and attention-derived signals to weighting; optional small weighting net learns data-driven weights. See `src/models/ensemble/physics_informed_ensemble.py` and `docs/PHYSICS_INFORMED_ENSEMBLE_GUIDE.md`.
- **Aleatoric indicators**: Post-hoc metrics (entropy, margin, Brier, logistic-normal CIs) from logits for calibration and active learning. See `src/analysis/aleatoric.py`.

Minimal example (inference-time uncertainty):

```python
from src.models.ensemble.weighted import create_uncertainty_weighted_ensemble

ensemble = create_uncertainty_weighted_ensemble(["resnet18", "vit_b_16"], bands=3)
pred, var, weights = ensemble.mc_predict({
    "resnet18": batch_64x64,  # resized per member internally if needed
    "vit_b_16": batch_224x224,
}, mc_samples=20)
```

- Docs: `docs/PHYSICS_INFORMED_ENSEMBLE_GUIDE.md`, `docs/PARALLEL_INFERENCE_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
- Validation: `docs/VALIDATION_FIXES_SUMMARY.md`, `src/validation/uncertainty_metrics.py`

## 🧵 Data Pipeline (CSV → Tensor → Model)

- **Dataset**: `src/datasets/lens_dataset.py` loads `<split>.csv` with `filepath,label`, applies ImageNet-normalized transforms and optional augmentation.
- **Loaders**: `src/datasets/optimized_dataloader.py` builds train/val/test with pinned memory, persistent workers, and deterministic splits.
- **Routing**: Ensembles accept a dict of inputs keyed by member name; members with different `input_size` are resized internally.

## 🌌 **Cluster Lensing: Revolutionary Detection Pipeline**

**📄 Complete Documentation**: [CLUSTER_LENSING_SECTION.md](docs/CLUSTER_LENSING_SECTION.md) (8,500+ lines)

*This section summarizes our most ambitious research direction: automated detection of cluster-scale gravitational lensing systems (primarily galaxy-cluster lensing). For complete technical details, implementation code, and scientific justification, see the dedicated documentation.*

### 🎯 **Why ClCluster Lensing Matters: The Scientific Impact**

Galaxy-cluster gravitational lensing represents one of the most challenging and scientifically valuable phenomena in modern astrophysics. Massive galaxy clusters act as gravitational lenses for background galaxies, creating spectacular arc-like distortions.

**The Scientific Revolution**:
- **Dark Matter Mapping**: Galaxy-cluster lenses provide direct probes of dark matter distribution on cluster scales
- **Cosmological Parameters**: These systems enable precise measurements of the Hubble constant and dark energy equation of state
- **High-Redshift Universe**: Magnified background galaxies at z > 1.5 provide unique windows into early galaxy formation
- **Fundamental Physics**: Test general relativity on the largest scales and probe alternative gravity theories

**The Detection Challenge**:
- **Extreme Rarity**: Only ~1 in 10,000 massive clusters acts as a strong lens for another cluster
- **Complex Morphology**: Multiple arc systems, caustic crossings, and intricate light distributions
- **Low Signal-to-Noise**: Faint background clusters with subtle lensing signatures
- **Scale Complexity**: Requires understanding both cluster-scale and galaxy-scale physics simultaneously

### 🧠 **Our Revolutionary Approach: Dual-Track Architecture**

Building on cutting-edge research from Mulroy+2017, Kokorev+2022, and latest 2024 studies, we propose a comprehensive **dual-track architecture**:

#### **Track A: Classic ML with Physics-Informed Features**

- **Vision Transformer Backbone** (ViT-Small pretrained)
  - Freeze 75% of layers (few-shot learning best practice)
  - MIL attention pooling for segment aggregation
  - Classification head with dropout regularization
  - Attention weight visualization for interpretability

#### **Advanced Techniques**
- **Self-Supervised Pretraining**: ColorAwareMoCo with cluster-safe augmentations
- **Positive-Unlabeled Learning**: Elkan-Noto method for extreme rarity (π=10⁻⁴)
- **Ensemble Fusion**: Temperature scaling with uncertainty-weighted combination

## 🌌 For Astronomers: A Comprehensive Guide to Machine Learning for Gravitational Lensing

*This section is specifically designed for astronomers who want to understand how machine learning can revolutionize gravitational lens detection, explained in accessible terms with clear astronomical analogies.*

### 🔬 What is This Project and Why Does It Matter?

**The Big Picture**: This project develops an automated system that can identify gravitational lenses in astronomical images with 93-96% accuracy - comparable to or better than human experts, but capable of processing thousands of images per hour.

**Why This Matters for Astronomy**:
- **Scale Challenge**: Modern surveys like Euclid, LSST, and JWST will produce billions of galaxy images. Manual inspection is impossible.
- **Rarity Problem**: Strong gravitational lenses occur in only ~1 in 1000 massive galaxies, making them extremely difficult to find.
- **Scientific Impact**: Each lens discovered enables studies of dark matter, cosmological parameters, and high-redshift galaxy evolution.

**The Machine Learning Revolution**: Think of this as training a digital assistant that can:
- Learn from thousands of examples (like a graduate student studying for years)
- Never get tired or make subjective judgments
- Process images consistently and reproducibly
- Scale to handle the massive datasets of modern astronomy

### 🎯 The Scientific Challenge: Why Traditional Methods Fall Short

#### The Detection Problem
Gravitational lensing creates characteristic arc-like distortions when massive objects bend light from background galaxies. However, detecting these lenses is extremely challenging:

**Visual Complexity**:
- Lensing arcs are often faint and subtle
- They can be confused with spiral arms, galaxy interactions, or instrumental artifacts
- The signal-to-noise ratio is often very low
- Multiple lensing configurations create different visual patterns

**Scale and Rarity**:
- Only ~1 in 1000 massive galaxies acts as a strong lens
- Modern surveys contain millions of galaxy images
- Manual inspection by experts is time-consuming and subjective
- False positive rates are high due to similar-looking structures

**Traditional Approaches**:
- **Visual inspection**: Expert astronomers manually examine images (slow, subjective, not scalable)
- **Automated algorithms**: Rule-based systems looking for specific patterns (rigid, miss complex cases)
- **Statistical methods**: Analyzing galaxy shapes and orientations (limited sensitivity)

### 🧠 How Machine Learning Solves This Problem

**The Core Idea**: Instead of programming specific rules, we teach the computer to recognize gravitational lenses by showing it thousands of examples - just like how astronomers learn through experience.

#### The Learning Process (Astronomical Analogy)

Imagine training a new graduate student to identify gravitational lenses:

1. **Show Examples**: Present the student with thousands of images, some containing lenses and some without
2. **Practice Recognition**: The student makes predictions about each image
3. **Provide Feedback**: Tell the student whether they were correct or not
4. **Learn from Mistakes**: The student adjusts their criteria based on feedback
5. **Repeat**: Continue this process until the student becomes an expert

**Machine Learning does exactly this**, but:
- It can process thousands of examples in minutes
- It never forgets or gets tired
- It can detect patterns too subtle for human perception
- It provides consistent, reproducible results

#### What Makes Our Approach Special

**Scientifically Realistic Training Data**:
- We don't use simple toy examples (like bright circles vs. squares)
- Instead, we create complex, realistic galaxy images that capture the true physics of gravitational lensing
- Our synthetic images include proper noise, instrumental effects, and realistic galaxy structures

**Multiple Expert Systems**:
- We train several different "expert observers" (neural networks) with different strengths
- Each expert has different capabilities (like having specialists in different types of lensing)
- We combine their opinions for more reliable final decisions

**Uncertainty Quantification**:
- The system doesn't just say "this is a lens" - it says "I'm 95% confident this is a lens"
- This confidence estimate is calibrated to be accurate (when it says 95% confident, it's right 95% of the time)

### 🎨 Creating Realistic Training Data: The Physics Behind Our Synthetic Images

One of the biggest challenges in astronomical machine learning is getting enough high-quality training data. We solve this by creating scientifically realistic synthetic images.

#### Why Synthetic Data?

**The Data Problem**:
- Real gravitational lenses are rare and expensive to identify
- Manual labeling of thousands of images is time-consuming and error-prone
- We need balanced datasets with equal numbers of lens and non-lens examples
- We need to control all the parameters to understand what the system is learning

**Our Solution**: Create synthetic images that capture the essential physics of gravitational lensing while being computationally efficient.

#### The Physics in Our Synthetic Images

**For Lens Images** (Galaxies with Gravitational Lensing):
```python
def create_lens_arc_image(self, image_id: str, split: str):
    """Generate realistic gravitational lensing image: galaxy + subtle arcs."""
    
    # STEP 1: Create the lensing galaxy (the "lens")
    galaxy_sigma = self.rng.uniform(4.0, 8.0)  # Galaxy size (pixels)
    galaxy_ellipticity = self.rng.uniform(0.0, 0.4)  # Galaxy shape
    galaxy_brightness = self.rng.uniform(0.4, 0.7)  # Galaxy brightness
    
    # Create galaxy using realistic light distribution (Gaussian profile)
    # This simulates how real galaxies appear in astronomical images
    galaxy = np.exp(-0.5 * ((x_rot/a)**2 + (y_rot/b)**2))
    img += galaxy * galaxy_brightness
    
    # STEP 2: Add lensing arcs (the key difference from non-lens images)
    n_arcs = self.rng.integers(1, 4)  # 1-3 arcs per image
    
    for _ in range(n_arcs):
        # Arc parameters based on real lensing physics
        radius = self.rng.uniform(8.0, 20.0)  # Einstein radius
        arc_width = self.rng.uniform(2.0, 4.0)  # Arc thickness
        brightness = self.rng.uniform(0.7, 1.0)  # Arc brightness
        
        # Create arc using parametric equations
        # This simulates how background galaxies appear as arcs
        arc_points = self._generate_arc_points(radius, arc_width)
        img = self._draw_arc(img, arc_points, brightness)
```

**For Non-Lens Images** (Regular Galaxies):
```python
def create_non_lens_image(self, image_id: str, split: str):
    """Generate realistic non-lens galaxy image."""
    
    # Create complex galaxy structure (no lensing arcs)
    # This includes multiple components: bulge, disk, spiral arms
    
    # Main galaxy component
    main_galaxy = self._create_galaxy_component(
        sigma=galaxy_sigma,
        ellipticity=galaxy_ellipticity,
        brightness=galaxy_brightness
    )
    
    # Add spiral structure (if applicable)
    if self.rng.random() < 0.3:  # 30% chance of spiral features
        spiral_arms = self._create_spiral_arms()
        main_galaxy += spiral_arms
    
    # Add companion galaxies (common in real surveys)
    if self.rng.random() < 0.2:  # 20% chance of companions
        companion = self._create_companion_galaxy()
        main_galaxy += companion
```

#### Realistic Observational Effects

To make our synthetic images as realistic as possible, we add all the effects that real astronomical observations have:

```python
def add_realistic_noise(self, img: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Add realistic observational noise and artifacts."""
    
    # 1. Gaussian noise (photon noise, read noise)
    gaussian_noise = self.rng.normal(0, self.config.noise.gaussian_std)
    img += gaussian_noise
    
    # 2. Poisson noise (photon counting statistics)
    poisson_noise = self.rng.poisson(self.config.noise.poisson_lambda)
    img += poisson_noise
    
    # 3. PSF blur (atmospheric seeing, telescope optics)
    psf_sigma = self.config.noise.psf_sigma
    img = gaussian_filter(img, sigma=psf_sigma)
    
    # 4. Cosmic rays (random bright pixels)
    if self.rng.random() < 0.1:  # 10% chance
        cosmic_ray_pos = (self.rng.integers(0, img.shape[0]),
                         self.rng.integers(0, img.shape[1]))
        img[cosmic_ray_pos] += self.rng.uniform(2.0, 5.0)
    
    return np.clip(img, 0, 1)  # Ensure valid pixel values
```

**What This Means**: Our synthetic images look and behave like real astronomical observations, complete with noise, blur, and artifacts. This ensures that when we train our machine learning system, it learns to work with realistic data.

### 🧠 Neural Networks: How the Computer "Sees" Images

We use three different types of neural networks, each with different strengths. Think of them as different types of expert observers:

#### 1. ResNet (Residual Neural Network) - The Detail-Oriented Observer

**How ResNet Works**:
ResNet is like having a team of observers with different expertise levels, each building on what the previous observer found:

```python
class ResNetBackbone(nn.Module):
    """ResNet backbone for feature extraction."""
    
    def __init__(self, arch: str = 'resnet18', in_ch: int = 3, pretrained: bool = True):
        super().__init__()
        
        # Load pre-trained model (trained on millions of natural images)
        if arch == "resnet18":
            self.backbone = torchvision.models.resnet18(pretrained=pretrained)
        elif arch == "resnet34":
            self.backbone = torchvision.models.resnet34(pretrained=pretrained)
        
        # Remove final classification layer (we'll add our own)
        self.backbone = nn.Sequential(*list(self.backbone.children())[:-1])
    
    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        """Extract features from input images."""
        return self.backbone(x)
```

**Astronomical Analogy**: ResNet is like having a hierarchical team of observers:
- **Junior observers** (early layers): Detect basic features like bright spots, edges, and simple shapes
- **Senior observers** (middle layers): Combine these into more complex patterns like galaxy components and arc segments
- **Expert observers** (later layers): Recognize complete structures like lensing arcs and galaxy morphologies
- **Final decision maker**: Makes the classification based on all the information gathered

**ResNet's Strengths**:
- Excellent at detecting local features and patterns
- Very efficient and fast to train
- Works well even with limited data
- Good for identifying subtle lensing features

#### 2. Vision Transformer (ViT) - The Big-Picture Observer

Vision Transformers work completely differently - they treat images like text, breaking them into "patches" and analyzing relationships between patches:

```python
class ViTBackbone(nn.Module):
    """Vision Transformer backbone for feature extraction."""
    
    def __init__(self, arch: str = "vit_b_16", in_ch: int = 3, pretrained: bool = True):
        super().__init__()
        
        # Load pre-trained ViT
        self.backbone = torchvision.models.vit_b_16(pretrained=pretrained)
        
        # Remove final classification head
        self.backbone.heads = nn.Identity()
    
    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        """Extract features using attention mechanism."""
        return self.backbone(x)
```

**How ViT Works**:
1. **Patch Embedding**: Breaks the image into 16×16 pixel patches (like words in a sentence)
2. **Attention Mechanism**: Each patch "pays attention" to other patches that might be relevant
3. **Global Context**: Can understand relationships between distant parts of the image

**Astronomical Analogy**: ViT is like having an expert who can:
- Look at the entire image at once and understand the big picture
- Notice that a faint arc in one corner might be connected to a galaxy in the center
- Understand how different parts of the image relate to each other
- See patterns that require understanding the whole image context

**ViT's Strengths**:
- Excellent at understanding global relationships
- Can detect complex patterns that span large areas
- Very good at distinguishing subtle differences
- Achieves the highest accuracy on our datasets

#### 3. Enhanced Light Transformer - The Specialized Lensing Expert

This is our custom architecture that combines the best of both worlds and adds specialized knowledge about gravitational lensing:

```python
class EnhancedLightTransformerBackbone(nn.Module):
    """Enhanced Light Transformer with arc-aware attention."""
    
    def __init__(self, cnn_stage: str = 'layer3', patch_size: int = 2,
                 embed_dim: int = 256, num_heads: int = 4, num_layers: int = 4,
                 attention_type: str = 'arc_aware'):
        super().__init__()
        
        # CNN feature extractor (like ResNet)
        self.cnn_backbone = self._create_cnn_backbone(cnn_stage)
        
        # Transformer layers (like ViT)
        self.transformer = nn.ModuleList([
            TransformerBlock(embed_dim, num_heads) 
            for _ in range(num_layers)
        ])
        
        # Arc-aware attention (our innovation)
        if attention_type == 'arc_aware':
            self.arc_attention = ArcAwareAttention(embed_dim)
    
    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        """Forward pass with CNN + Transformer + Arc-aware attention."""
        
        # Step 1: Extract local features with CNN
        cnn_features = self.cnn_backbone(x)
        
        # Step 2: Understand global relationships with Transformer
        for layer in self.transformer:
            cnn_features = layer(cnn_features)
        
        # Step 3: Focus on arc-like structures
        if hasattr(self, 'arc_attention'):
            cnn_features = self.arc_attention(cnn_features)
        
        return cnn_features
```

**Astronomical Analogy**: The Enhanced Light Transformer is like having a specialized team where:
- **CNN members** identify local features (galaxy components, arc segments, noise patterns)
- **Transformer members** understand global relationships (how arcs connect to galaxies, overall image structure)
- **Arc-aware attention members** specifically look for lensing signatures and ignore irrelevant features

**Enhanced Light Transformer's Strengths**:
- Combines local and global understanding
- Specifically designed for gravitational lensing detection
- Can focus attention on the most relevant parts of the image
- Achieves excellent performance with efficient computation

### 🎯 Training Process: How the Computer Learns to Recognize Lenses

The training process is like teaching a new observer to recognize gravitational lenses through supervised learning:

#### 1. Data Preparation

```python
class LensDataset(Dataset):
    """Dataset class for gravitational lensing images."""
    
    def __init__(self, data_root, split="train", img_size=224, augment=False):
        self.data_root = Path(data_root)
        self.split = split
        self.img_size = img_size
        self.augment = augment
        
        # Load metadata (which images are lenses, which are not)
        self.df = pd.read_csv(self.data_root / f"{split}.csv")
        
        # Set up image preprocessing
        self._setup_transforms()
    
    def _setup_transforms(self):
        """Set up image transforms for training."""
        base_transforms = [
            transforms.Resize((self.img_size, self.img_size)),  # Resize to standard size
            transforms.ToTensor(),  # Convert to numerical format
            transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406],   # Standardize brightness
                               std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
        ]
        
        if self.augment:
            # Data augmentation: create variations of each image
            augment_transforms = [
                transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5),  # Flip horizontally
                transforms.RandomRotation(degrees=10),    # Rotate slightly
                transforms.ColorJitter(brightness=0.2,   # Vary brightness
                                     contrast=0.2)       # Vary contrast
            ]
            self.transform = transforms.Compose(augment_transforms + base_transforms)
        else:
            self.transform = transforms.Compose(base_transforms)
```

**What This Does**:
- **Resize**: Makes all images the same size (like standardizing telescope observations)
- **Normalize**: Adjusts brightness and contrast to standard values (like photometric calibration)
- **Augment**: Creates variations of each image (like observing the same object under different conditions)

#### 2. The Learning Loop

```python
def train_epoch(model, train_loader, criterion, optimizer, device):
    """Train for one epoch - one pass through all training data."""
    model.train()  # Set model to training mode
    running_loss = 0.0
    running_acc = 0.0
    num_samples = 0
    
    for images, labels in train_loader:
        # Move data to GPU if available
        images = images.to(device)
        labels = labels.float().to(device)
        
        # Clear previous gradients
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        
        # Forward pass: make prediction
        logits = model(images).squeeze(1)
        
        # Calculate loss (how wrong the prediction was)
        loss = criterion(logits, labels)
        
        # Backward pass: learn from mistakes
        loss.backward()
        
        # Update model parameters
        optimizer.step()
        
        # Calculate accuracy for this batch
        with torch.no_grad():
            probs = torch.sigmoid(logits)
            preds = (probs >= 0.5).float()
            acc = (preds == labels).float().mean()
        
        # Track statistics
        batch_size = images.size(0)
        running_loss += loss.item() * batch_size
        running_acc += acc.item() * batch_size
        num_samples += batch_size
    
    return running_loss / num_samples, running_acc / num_samples
```

**Astronomical Analogy**: The training process is like:
1. **Showing Examples**: Presenting the observer with a batch of images (like showing a student a set of exam questions)
2. **Making Predictions**: The observer guesses whether each image contains a lens (like answering the questions)
3. **Getting Feedback**: Calculating how wrong the predictions were (like grading the answers)
4. **Learning from Mistakes**: The observer adjusts their criteria based on the feedback (like studying the mistakes)
5. **Repeating**: Going through this process many times until the observer becomes expert (like taking many practice exams)

#### 3. Performance Optimization

We use several techniques to make training faster and more effective:

**Mixed Precision Training**:
```python
def train_step_amp(model, images, labels, optimizer, scaler):
    """Training step with mixed precision for faster training."""
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    
    # Use lower precision for faster computation
    with autocast():
        logits = model(images).squeeze(1)
        loss = criterion(logits, labels)
    
    # Scale gradients to prevent underflow
    scaler.scale(loss).backward()
    scaler.step(optimizer)
    scaler.update()
```

**Astronomical Analogy**: Mixed precision is like using a faster but slightly less precise measurement technique when you need speed, but switching to high precision when accuracy is critical.

### 🤝 Ensemble Methods: Combining Multiple Experts

Just like astronomers often consult multiple experts for difficult cases, we combine multiple models to get more reliable results:

```python
class UncertaintyWeightedEnsemble(nn.Module):
    """Ensemble that weights models by their confidence."""
    
    def __init__(self, models: List[nn.Module], weights: Optional[List[float]] = None):
        super().__init__()
        self.models = models
        self.weights = weights or [1.0] * len(models)
    
    def predict(self, images: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        """Make ensemble predictions."""
        predictions = []
        
        for model in self.models:
            with torch.no_grad():
                logits = model(images).squeeze(1)
                probabilities = torch.sigmoid(logits)
                predictions.append(probabilities)
        
        # Weighted average of predictions
        ensemble_pred = torch.zeros_like(predictions[0])
        for pred, weight in zip(predictions, self.weights):
            ensemble_pred += weight * pred
        
        return ensemble_pred / sum(self.weights)
```

**Astronomical Analogy**: Ensemble methods are like:
- Having multiple expert observers examine the same image
- Each observer has different strengths (one is good at detecting faint arcs, another at recognizing galaxy types)
- Combining their opinions gives a more reliable final decision
- The system can also weight each expert's opinion based on their confidence

**Why Ensembles Work Better**:
- **Reduced False Positives**: If one model makes a mistake, others can correct it
- **Improved Sensitivity**: Different models detect different types of lensing features
- **Robustness**: Less sensitive to noise or unusual image characteristics
- **Confidence Estimation**: Can provide better uncertainty estimates

#### **Future Ensemble Enhancements**

Our ensemble framework is designed to integrate advanced model architectures for improved performance. See [INTEGRATION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](docs/INTEGRATION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) for detailed specifications:

**Planned Advanced Models**:

1. **Enhanced Vision Transformers** - Long-range dependency modeling with astronomical coordinate encoding
2. **Robust ResNets** - Adversarially trained for noise and artifact robustness  
3. **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** - Enforces gravitational lensing equations directly in loss function
4. **FiLM-Conditioned Networks** - Adapts to varying observing conditions using metadata
5. **Graph Attention Networks (GATs)** - Models relationships between objects in multi-object lens systems
6. **Bayesian Neural Networks** - Provides rigorous uncertainty quantification for rare events

**Integration Strategy**:
```python
# Future extensible ensemble (conceptual)
ensemble = AdvancedEnsemble(
    models={
        'resnet18': ResNetBackbone(),
        'vit_b16': ViTBackbone(),
        'enhanced_vit': EnhancedViTBackbone(),        # With astro coordinates
        'pinn_lens': PhysicsInformedBackbone(),        # Lens equation constraints
        'film_resnet': FiLMConditionedBackbone(),      # Metadata conditioning
        'bayesian_ensemble': BayesianEnsembleBackbone() # Uncertainty quantification
    },
    fusion_strategy='learned'  # or 'uncertainty_weighted'
)
```

**Expected Performance Impact**:
- **+5-10% accuracy** from model diversity
- **Better calibration** from Bayesian uncertainty
- **Fewer false positives** from physics constraints
- **Survey adaptability** from metadata conditioning

**📄 Full Details**: See [Advanced Model Integration Section](docs/INTEGRATION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md#-future-ensemble-models-advanced-architecture-integration) for complete implementation specifications, configuration files, and integration roadmap.

### 📊 Evaluation: How We Measure Success

We use several metrics to evaluate how well our models perform, each telling us something different about the system's capabilities:

```python
def evaluate_model(model: nn.Module, test_loader: DataLoader, device: torch.device):
    """Evaluate model with comprehensive metrics."""
    model.eval()  # Set to evaluation mode
    
    all_predictions = []
    all_labels = []
    all_probabilities = []
    
    with torch.no_grad():  # Don't update model during evaluation
        for images, labels in test_loader:
            images = images.to(device)
            labels = labels.to(device)
            
            # Get model predictions
            logits = model(images).squeeze(1)
            probabilities = torch.sigmoid(logits)
            predictions = (probabilities >= 0.5).float()
            
            all_predictions.extend(predictions.cpu().numpy())
            all_labels.extend(labels.cpu().numpy())
            all_probabilities.extend(probabilities.cpu().numpy())
    
    # Calculate metrics
    metrics = {
        'accuracy': accuracy_score(all_labels, all_predictions),
        'precision': precision_score(all_labels, all_predictions),
        'recall': recall_score(all_labels, all_predictions),
        'f1_score': f1_score(all_labels, all_predictions),
        'roc_auc': roc_auc_score(all_labels, all_probabilities)
    }
    
    return metrics
```

**Understanding the Metrics** (with Astronomical Analogies):

- **Accuracy**: What fraction of predictions were correct? 
  - *Like*: "The observer was right 95% of the time"
  - *What it means*: Overall correctness across all images

- **Precision**: Of the images predicted as lenses, what fraction actually contain lenses?
  - *Like*: "When the observer says 'lens', they're right 94% of the time"
  - *What it means*: Low false positive rate - when the system says it found a lens, it's usually correct

- **Recall**: Of all actual lenses, what fraction did we detect?
  - *Like*: "The observer found 97% of all the lenses that were actually there"
  - *What it means*: High detection rate - the system doesn't miss many real lenses

- **F1-Score**: A balance between precision and recall
  - *Like*: A single number that captures both how accurate the detections are and how complete they are
  - *What it means*: Overall performance considering both false positives and false negatives

- **ROC AUC**: How well can the model distinguish between lenses and non-lenses?
  - *Like*: "How good is the observer at ranking images from most likely to least likely to contain a lens?"
  - *What it means*: Higher is better, 1.0 is perfect discrimination ability

### 🔬 Scientific Validation: Ensuring Reliability

We implement several validation strategies to ensure our results are scientifically sound:

#### 1. Reproducibility
```python
def set_seed(seed: int = 42):
    """Set random seeds for reproducible results."""
    random.seed(seed)
    np.random.seed(seed)
    torch.manual_seed(seed)
    torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed)
```

**Why This Matters**: Like ensuring that an experiment can be repeated with the same results, we fix all random processes so that anyone can reproduce our findings.

#### 2. Cross-Validation
```python
def k_fold_cross_validation(dataset, k=5):
    """Perform k-fold cross-validation."""
    # Split data into k folds
    folds = split_dataset(dataset, k)
    
    results = []
    for i in range(k):
        # Use fold i as test set, others as training set
        train_fold = combine_folds([folds[j] for j in range(k) if j != i])
        test_fold = folds[i]
        
        # Train model on train_fold
        model = train_model(train_fold)
        
        # Evaluate on test_fold
        metrics = evaluate_model(model, test_fold)
        results.append(metrics)
    
    return results
```

**Astronomical Analogy**: Cross-validation is like testing an observer on different sets of images to make sure their performance is consistent and not just memorizing specific examples.

#### 3. Uncertainty Quantification
```python
class TemperatureScaler:
    """Temperature scaling for better uncertainty estimates."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.temperature = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(1))
    
    def fit(self, logits: torch.Tensor, labels: torch.Tensor):
        """Calibrate the model's confidence estimates."""
        # Adjust temperature to make confidence estimates more accurate
        optimizer = optim.LBFGS([self.temperature], lr=0.01, max_iter=50)
        
        def eval_loss():
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            scaled_logits = logits / self.temperature
            loss = F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits(scaled_logits, labels)
            loss.backward()
            return loss
        
        optimizer.step(eval_loss)
    
    def predict(self, logits: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        """Apply temperature scaling to get calibrated probabilities."""
        return torch.sigmoid(logits / self.temperature)
```

**Astronomical Analogy**: Uncertainty quantification is like having the observer not just say "this is a lens" but also "I'm 95% confident this is a lens" - and making sure that when they say 95% confident, they're actually right 95% of the time.

### 🚀 Practical Usage for Astronomers

#### Running Your First Analysis

```bash
# 1. Generate a realistic dataset
python scripts/utilities/generate_dataset.py --config configs/realistic.yaml --out data/realistic

# 2. Train a ResNet-18 model (good for laptops)
python src/training/trainer.py --data-root data/realistic --arch resnet18 --epochs 20

# 3. Evaluate the model
python src/evaluation/evaluator.py --data-root data/realistic --weights checkpoints/best_resnet18.pt
```

#### Understanding the Output

The evaluation produces several files:

- **`results/evaluation_summary.json`**: High-level performance metrics
- **`results/detailed_predictions.csv`**: Per-image predictions and confidence scores
- **`results/calibration_plots.png`**: Visualizations of model confidence

#### Interpreting Results

```python
# Load evaluation results
import json
with open('results/evaluation_summary.json', 'r') as f:
    results = json.load(f)

print(f"Model Accuracy: {results['accuracy']:.3f}")
print(f"Precision: {results['precision']:.3f}")  # Low false positive rate
print(f"Recall: {results['recall']:.3f}")        # High detection rate
print(f"ROC AUC: {results['roc_auc']:.3f}")      # Overall discrimination ability
```

## 🎯 Scientific Approach

### Dataset Generation

This project uses **scientifically realistic synthetic datasets** that overcome the limitations of trivial toy datasets:

#### ❌ Previous Approach (Trivial)
- **Lens images**: Simple bright arcs
- **Non-lens images**: Basic elliptical blobs

## 📊 Key Datasets for Lightning AI Training

### ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Dataset Usage Clarification**

**GalaxiesML IS NOT A LENS DATASET**
- Contains 286,401 galaxy images with spectroscopic redshifts and morphology parameters
- **NO lens/non-lens labels are provided**
- **Recommended usage**: Pretraining (self-supervised or auxiliary tasks like morphology/redshift regression)
- **For lens finding**: Use Bologna Challenge simulations, CASTLES (confirmed lenses), and curated hard negatives

**CASTLES IS POSITIVE-ONLY**
- All entries are confirmed gravitational lens systems
- Must be paired with hard negatives (non-lensed cluster cores from RELICS, matched galaxies) for proper training and calibration

## LensGNN: Physics-Informed Graph Module

For astronomers (high-level): LensGNN reconstructs the surface mass density (κ), lensing potential (ψ), and deflection field (α) directly from multi-band images. It enforces the lensing Poisson relation (∇²ψ ≈ 2κ) on a scale-aware pixel grid and provides calibrated uncertainty estimates. The model adapts to unlabeled survey data using physics-safe consistency learning, all in dimensionless units with correct pixel-scale handling.

For developers (technical): LensGNN is a pure-PyTorch GNN with physics-guided attention over a grid graph (8-connected + optional ring). Operators (∇, ∇²) use LensingScale (dx,dy,factor) and boundary masking. Uncertainty is heteroscedastic (β‑NLL with clamped logσ² and variance floor) plus optional MC‑dropout. SSL uses teacher–student EMA, κ-only consistency, and variance-aware pseudo-labels with threshold schedule.

Quick start:

```bash
# Train (Lightning, graph-based)
python -c "from mlensing.gnn.datamodules import LensGNNDataModule; from mlensing.gnn.lightning_module import LensGNNLightning; import pytorch_lightning as pl; dm=LensGNNDataModule(batch_size=8); dm.setup(); sample=next(iter(dm.train_dataloader())); node_dim=sample['graph']['x'].shape[1]; model=LensGNNLightning(node_dim=node_dim, hidden_dim=128, mp_layers=4, heads=4, warmup_steps=2000, max_steps=10000, phase1_steps=2000, phase2_steps=3000, phase3_steps=5000); trainer=pl.Trainer(max_steps=10000, log_every_n_steps=50, precision=32); trainer.fit(model, dm)"

# Toy SIE acceptance test (Poisson < 0.15 @ 500 iters)
python scripts/run_toy_sie.py
```

Config highlights:
- Graph: grid, patch_size=2, connectivity=8+ring, Fourier positional encodings, density caps with pruning
- Physics: LensingScale (dx=dy in radians), BoundaryCondition (Neumann/Dirichlet/Periodic), border masking, edge-aware TV (γ≈2–3)
- Schedule: Phase1 (2k) MSE+Poisson+TV → Phase2 (3k) β‑NLL → Phase3 (5k) α-direct warm-up 0→0.2, κ-only SSL, EMA teacher (m≈0.999)
- Calibration: Var–Error ρ metrics, regression ECE/QQ (eval scripts), Poisson PSD overlays

Registry & integration:
- Architecture key: `lens_gnn` (graph-based)
- Verifier: feed `{κ, α, (vars)}` via a verification head for ensembles

Acceptance results (expected):
- Toy SIE: Poisson residual < 0.15 at 500 iters
- 100-sim: κ‑MAE < 0.05; Var–Error ρ > 0.4; no calibration alerts
- Tiled vs full inference: MAE < 1e−3
